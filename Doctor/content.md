Doctor Doctor I feel like a pair of curtains.
Pull your self together.


Doctor Doctor I keep dreaming of Teepees and Wigwams
You are two tense


Doctor Doctor I swallowed a bone.
Are you choking?
No, I really did! 


Doctor, doctor I keep thinking I'm a bee
Buzz off can't you see I'm busy? 


Doctor, Doctor I feel like a sheep.
That's baaaaaaaaaad!


Doctor, Doctor I think I'm suffering from Deja Vu!
Didn't I see you yesterday?
